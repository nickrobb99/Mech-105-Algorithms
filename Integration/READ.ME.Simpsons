This Function needs an input of to vectors of data. The first vector 'x' should contain all of the independent variables data 
points. The second vector 'y' should contain all of the dependent variables data points. The function will then apply the
Simpson's 1/3 Rule and give an integral approximation of the data. If needed, the function will also apply the trapezoidal rule
for more accurate results.
